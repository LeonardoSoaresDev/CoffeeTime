# Rest API
Web Java Application API

This is a simple project, with the objective of learning more about how the backend works using Spring Boot Framework.

In this project you will see a simple Rest API that only records and retrieves data from a database.

To facilitate interaction with the database, JPA and Hibernate were used, together with the PgAdmin of the PostgreSQL database.

The database used was the previously mentioned PostgreSQL, installed locally as well as the API, both running locally.

Currently the project runs only locally.
