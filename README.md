# Rest API
Web Java Application API

This is a simple project, with the objective of learning more about how the backend works using Spring Boot Framework.

In this project you will see a simple Rest API using the CRUD methods (Create, Research, Update, Delete).

As an example, in order to use the CRUD methods, i'm using fictional coffee as items to be saved and manipulated into the database. ![java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54752833/107232028-b63d9c00-69ff-11eb-9720-e1f1ced8f158.png)


To facilitate interaction with the database, JPA and Hibernate were used, together with the PgAdmin of the PostgreSQL database.

The database used was the previously mentioned PostgreSQL, installed locally as well as the API, both running locally.

Currently the project runs only locally.
